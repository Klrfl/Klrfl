- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Klrfl!
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in full-stack web development, but for now I want to be a front-end developer first
- ğŸŒ± I have experience in JavaScript, Vue, Astro and React, I am currently learning various new and exciting technologies such as Tailwind and Supabase. I also have a bit of experience in Python and C. On the backend side, I have dabbled a little bit with PostgreSQL and Go.
